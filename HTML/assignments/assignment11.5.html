        <h3><u>playing CRICKET</u></h3>
        <pre style="color: blue">
            Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field 
            at the centre of which is a 20-metre (22-yard) pitch with a wicket at each end, each 
            comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking 
            the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat, while the bowling and fielding side tries to 
            prevent this and dismiss each player (so they are "out").

        <h3><u>listening MUSIC</u></h3>
        <pre style="color: blue">
            Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time.
            General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch (which governs
            melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation)
            dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture
            (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound).<hr>
